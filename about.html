                    <!-- p is the paragraph tag - by default there is spacing around it -->        
                    <p>Founded in 2023, Pandora's Prints started as a small hobby that quickly grew into a full-fledged workshop. We realized there was a growing need for accessible, beginner-friendly workshops that allow anyone to dive into the trades. Whether you're learning 3D printing or mastering glass blowing, we aim to make these skills approachable and fun for everyone.</p>
                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>Our goal is to inspire creativity and empower people to create with their hands. By offering a variety of workshops, we provide the opportunity to learn something new, foster personal growth, and build a community of makers.</p>
